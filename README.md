# Project: Image Classification with Multilayer Neural Network

## Introduction

In this project, our primary aim is to develop a multilayer neural network capable of classifying images into their corresponding categories. We will be using the **CIFAR100** dataset, which is a large-scale dataset containing a wide variety of visual objects.

## Team Members

This project is a collaborative effort between the following team members:

1. **Ahmed Hisham Fathy Hassabou**
   - Student ID: 19P4007

2. **Eslam Elhusseini**
   - Student ID: 19P9651

## Project Goals

Our project can be broken down into several key objectives:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - We will select at least 500 visual objects from the ImageNet dataset and construct a suitable dataset for each object, ensuring an appropriate number of images per category.
   - The data will be divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - We will explore various image feature extraction techniques, such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) and others, to represent our images effectively.

3. **Data Normalization:**
   - We will normalize our data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation at each dimension. The normalized data will be visualized for further analysis.

4. **Neural Network Design:**
   - Using TensorFlow, we will design a multilayer neural network architecture tailored for image classification.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - We will employ cross-validation to determine the optimal number of hidden layers and nodes per layer in our neural network.

6. **Training and Visualization:**
   - The training process, including loss vs. iterations, will be visualized to monitor the model's learning progress.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - We will assess the performance of our model on the test set and report the best accuracy achieved.

8. **Comparison with AutoKeras:**
   - We will compare our results with a model generated by AutoKeras for our dataset.
